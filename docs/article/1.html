<p>So, I had heard that one could host a static webpage with GitHub. I’ve built static webpages before! In school… They used iframes based on tutorials from w3schools.</p>
<p>I kinda started to do this about a year ago and forgot. All I had done was a readme with the text “trying to make a webpage.” Well, I have a new tool now - modern medicine! (ADHD diagnosis and Adderall).</p>
<p>The Pages setting in the repository has a handy link to add a Jekyll theme <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll">https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll</a>. Just fork a repository, install Ruby, pick a theme, wait install Ruby? I got pretty mixed up in the instructions - turns out I probably didn’t need to test it locally anyway (on Windows, which complicates things). Oh well, I gave up to try to find something simpler.</p>
<p>After searching some themes and templates, I found a similar path that worked out. The handmade-blog from parksb has pretty simple instructions and is published as a template. Without rehasing the readme too much, here’s how it worked for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the template (all branches), named as [github user].github.io</li>
<li>Clone to editor of choice (VS Code)</li>
<li>Discover that running and building requires NPM (Javascript stuff I’ve never done), which requires Linux(?)</li>
<li>Install WSL, and the VS Code extension</li>
<li>Install NPM in WSL</li>
<li>Connect VS Code to WSL using extension, and clone again (also delete the repository from Windows)</li>
<li>Edit -&gt; npm build -&gt; npm start -&gt; runs on a local web server for review -&gt; repeat</li>
<li>Publish by committing and pushing(? still unclear on git terminology). I haven’t actually tested this step at time of writing.</li>
</ol>
<p>After I publish this article, it’s time to work on the rest of the site.</p>
